## 🧠 Architecture Philosophy

This project follows marketplace-first UX principles:

1. **Search-driven navigation**
2. **Category browsing**
3. **Featured product discovery**
4. **Use-case targeting**
5. **Trust reinforcement**
6. **Operational credibility**

Each section is intentionally layered to guide users:

```
Hero → Browse → Products → Targeted Recommendations → Trust → Footer
```
